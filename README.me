hector-statsd is a [Hector](https://github.com/sstephenson/hector) extension which sends statistics to a [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) server. You may configure custom statistics to accompany the following:

* `traffic.in` -- All lines received by Hector
* `traffic.out` -- All lines sent by Hector
* `connections` -- The number of active connections
* `ssl_connections` -- The number of active SSL connections (as a subset of `connections`)

hector-statsd works with any statsd client which responds to `increment(stat_name)` and `decrement(stat_name)`, such as [statsd-ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/statsd-ruby).

### Installation and usage

Install the [hector-statsd gem](https://rubygems.com/gems/hector-statsd) and navigate to your server:

```shell
$ gem install hector-statsd
$ cd myserver.hect
```

Load hector-statsd in `init.rb` and configure it with a statsd client and namespace:

```ruby
require "hector/statsd"
require "statsd"
Hector.statsd.client = Statsd.new("statsd.example.com", 8125)
Hector.statsd.namespace = "com.example.hector"
```

Track any [Hector event](https://github.com/sstephenson/hector/tree/master/lib/hector/commands) with a custom statistic:

```ruby
Hector.statsd.track "messages", :received_privmsg
```

You may also watch for a regex pattern in the response text. To keep track of people addressing Sam:

```ruby
Hector.statsd.track "messages.sam", :received_privmsg, /^sam:/i
```
